# OOP Mini Projects ‚Äì Python

This repository contains implementations of five mini projects based on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Each program demonstrates key OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, and method overloading.

## üìÅ Project List

### 1. Library Access System
- **Description**: A simplified library system with base class `Member` and subclass `StudentMember`.
- **Features**:
  - Add and return books.
  - Display current borrowing status.

### 2. Drone Fleet Management
- **Description**: A system to manage a fleet of drones using multiple inheritance.
- **Classes**:
  - `Device`: Basic device information.
  - `Flyer`: Flying capability.
  - `Drone`: Inherits from both and adds image capture functionality.

### 3. Online Learning Platform
- **Description**: A class hierarchy for managing users, instructors, and course creators.
- **Features**:
  - Role-specific data and method overriding.
  - Instructors can upload content, Course Creators can create courses.

### 4. Smart Home Appliance
- **Description**: Control and monitor different smart home devices using polymorphism.
- **Devices**:
  - Fan, Light, and AC with device-specific `status()` messages.

### 5. Geometry Toolkit
- **Description**: A class to calculate areas of shapes using simulated method overloading.
- **Functionality**:
  - One argument: Calculates area of a circle.
  - Two arguments: Calculates area of a rectangle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OOP Principles: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Overriding, Overloading
